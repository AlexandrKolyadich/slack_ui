                  <p> A farmer was sitting in the neighborhood bar getting drunk. A man came in and asked the farmer, "Hey, why are you sitting here on this beautiful day, getting drunk?" The farmer shook his head and replied, "Some things you just can't explain."</p>
                  <p>"So what happened that's so horrible?" the man asked as he sat down next to the farmer.</p>
                  <p>"Well," the farmer said, "today I was sitting by my cow, milking her. Just as I got the bucket full, she lifted her left leg and kicked over the bucket."</p>
                  <p>"Okay," said the man, "but that's not so bad." "Some things you just can't explain," the farmer replied. "So what happened then?" the man asked. The farmer said, "I took her left leg and tied it to the post on the left."</p>
                  <p>"And then?"😉</p>
                  <p>"Well, I sat back down and continued to milk her. Just as I got the bucket full, she took her right leg and kicked over the bucket."</p>
                  <p>The man laughed and said, "Again?" The farmer replied, "Some things you just can't explain." "So, what did you do then?" the man asked.</p>
                  <p>"I took her right leg this time and tied it to the post on the right."</p>
                  <p>"And then?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, I sat back down and began milking her again. Just as I got the bucket full, the stupid cow knocked over the bucket with her tail."</p>
                  <p>"Hmmm," the man said and nodded his head. "Some things you just can't explain," the farmer said.</p>
                  <p> "So, what did you do?" the man asked.🤪</p>
                  <p>"Well," the farmer said, "I didn't have anymore rope, so I took off my belt and tied her tail to the rafter. In that moment, my pants fell down and my wife walked in ... Some things you just can't explain."😂😂😂</p>

                  <p>An Irishman walks into a bar in Dublin, orders three pints of Guinness and sits in the back of the room, drinking a sip out of each one in turn. When he finished all three, he comes back to the bar and orders three more.</p>
                  <p>The bartender says to him, 'You know, a pint goes flat after I draw it; it would taste better if you bought one at a time.' The Irishman replies, 'Well, you see, I have two brothers. One is in America, the other in Australia, and I'm here in Dublin.</p>
                  <p>When we all left home, we promised that we'd drink this way to remember the days we all drank together.🤣</p>
                  <p>'The bartender admits that this is a nice custom, and leaves it there. The Irishman becomes a regular in the bar and always drinks the same way: he orders three pints and drinks the three pints by taking drinks from each of them in turn.</p>
                  <p>One day, he comes in and orders two pints. All the other regulars in the bar notice and fall silent.😅</p>
                  <p>When he comes back to the bar for the second round, the bartender says, 'I don't want to intrude on your grief, but I wanted to offer my condolences on your great loss.' The Irishman looks confused for a moment, then a lights dawns in his eye and he laughs.</p>
                  <p>'Oh, no, ' he says, 'Everyone is fine. I've just quit drinking!🤣</p>

                  <p>An autopsy professor was giving an introductory lecture to a class of students. Standing over a corpse, he addressed the class.</p>
                  <p>"There are two things you need to make a career in medical forensics. First, you must have no fear." Having said that, he shoved his finger up the corpse's anus and licked it.🤔</p>
                  <p>"Now you must do the same," he told the class. After a couple of minutes of uneasy silence, the class did as instructed. "Second," the professor continued, "you must have an acute sense of observation.</p>
                  <p>For instance, how many of you noticed that I put my middle finger up this man's anus, but licked my index finger?"</p>

                  <p>"Promise me you won't tell me." Confused, the father asked what was wrong "Oh dad," the boy sobbed, "when I was 6 I got the "there's no Santa" speech.</p>
                  <p>At 7, I got the "there's no Easter Bunny" speech. When I was 8, you hit me with the "there's no tooth fairy" speech.</p>
